## Raising an issue

We are actively on the look out to make this tool better and we allow users to raise issues they encounter when using PHPSandbox CLI. Issues would likely fall in either as</p>
<ol>
<li>Bug report</li>
<li>Feature request</li>
<li>Question and discussion<br>
All these have issue templates that provides a guideline on how we prefer they are done. Also before raising an issue, ensure that it is not part of a currently opened issue. Issues that falls under the question and discussion category can be responded to by anyone.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sending a pull request</p>
<ol>
<li>We have a Pull request template to guide users on the details  we expect that a Pull request should have.</li>
<li>Generally , before sending a pull request, check to see that an existing pull request does not exist solving the same problem.</li>
<li>You should create an issue describing the problem being solved by the Pull request. It could also be a new feature you are writing. For this you can use the feature request issue template.</li>
<li>The issue must be referenced and linked to the pull request.</li>
<li>A pull request should only provide one solution.</li>
<li>A pull request must have tests and all tests must pass.</li>
<li>Run <strong>composer fix-style</strong> to lint your code before committing.</li>
<li>You should also check our coding guidelines to see how we expect your code to be structured.</li>
<li>Our releases follows the <a href="https://semver.org/">semver</a> versioning system hence we expect that contributions to minor releases should contain no breaking changes.<br>
10.All Pull Request should be made against the dev branch.</li>
